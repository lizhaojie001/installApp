Johnny's open source license, v0.1
----------------------------------

This is (well, will be, at the time of writing) open source, and I can't but appeal to your sense of decency. You might try compile this and try to pass it as your own. Heck, you might even try to run it through llvm-obfuscator. But that would be stealing code. And obfuscate as you will, you can't obfuscate enough to hide the methods. So, primum non nocere. Do no harm, and do not steal.

To be fully clear:

 - Yes, you may use this source as you see fit, PROVIDED THAT:

	- IT IS NOT USED COMMERCIALLY IN ANY WAY. For this, I ask that you contact my company, @Technologeeks, and ask for proper licensing.
	- IT IS NOT USED AS A COMPONENT OF AN APT IN ANY KIND FORM OR MANNER. (NSO/Hackin9/Finfisher/Equus/etc - that means you)
	- WHEN YOU DO USE IT, YOU MENTION THAT YOUR TOOL IS "powered by the QiLin Toolkit", or otherwise provide a user facing indication that it is using this code.

  - There are no limitation on nationality, specific people exclusions, or any other race, color or creed - provided the above are met.

Should you wish to contribute/donate, you may do so in one of the following ways:

	- Monetary: Pick a charity. Any charity. Of your choice. Pay them however money you want. 
		    Optionally, tweet/fb/insta/snap-whatever a screen capture stating "#QiLin". 

        - Development: Through http://NewOSXBook.com/forum - you are welcome to ask (proper technical, not lame wen eta) questions and engage in discussions
	
	- Efforts: Get my books, or get the training by @Technologeeks.


First, do no harm. Next, have fun :-)
